# Github Action Sandbox

Work on building and using actions here.

## Notes

- Syracuse University Org does not allow gh-actions tokens to create pull requests by default
  - release-please creates a branch that tracks the changelog, but you will have to merge it
- You can search for verfieid organizations in actions marketplace with [this filter](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&verification=verified_creator)
